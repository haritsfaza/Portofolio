# Ahmad Harits Faza - Portofolio
# About
Hi, I'm Faza! I have an analytical background in Science Atmospheric and planetary and hold a Bachelor of Science degree. I recently completed a Data Scientist training program at Rakamin Academy, where I developed practical skills in data analysis, machine learning, and data visualization. With a strong foundation in the life sciences and a growing passion for uncovering insights through data, I’m excited to apply my technical and analytical skills in an entry-level data specialist role.

During my studies, I honed my ability to work with complex data and developed a keen eye for identifying patterns and trends. I also gained experience in laboratory techniques, data management, and statistical analysis, which I believe will be valuable assets in my role as a data specialist.

In my free time, I enjoy exploring new data analysis tools and techniques, and I am always looking for opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills. Whether working on a team or independently, I am driven by the thrill of discovering new insights and the satisfaction of using data to solve complex problems.

# Portofolio Projects

In this section I will list data analytics projects briefly describing the technology stack used to solve cases.

# Analyze Chocolate Sales
**Code:** [Chocolate Sales.ipynb](https://github.com/haritsfaza/Chocolate-Sales/blob/main/Chocolate%20Sales.ipynb)

**Goal:** To analyze and increase chocolate sales.

**Description:** The project focused on analyzing a dataset of Chocolate sales in January 2022 - August 2022. The dataset include prodcut, country, sales person, amount, shipped boxes, and date. The involved loading the data, cleaning and preprocessing it, performing exploring data analysis (EDA), Analyzing the correlation of sales, and visualizing.

**Skills:** data cleaning, data analysis, correlation matrices, hypothesis testing, data visualization.

**Technology:**  Python, Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib.

**Results:** Using Python functions the analysis knowing the relevance of sales per month it is known that chocolate sales increase depending on the season. in winter and holidays chocolate sales increase greatly.

# Credit Card Fraud Detection
**Code:** [creditcard.ipynb](https://github.com/haritsfaza/credit-card-fraud-detection/blob/main/creditcard.ipynb)

**Dataset:** [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud)

**Goal:** The goal of this project is to automatically detect fraudulent credit card transactions based on patterns from historical data. Since the number of fraud cases is very small compared to normal transactions.

**Description:** The project focused on analyzing a dataset of credit card transactions to detect fraudulent activity. The dataset contains transactions made by European cardholders in September 2013, including anonymized features derived from PCA, transaction amount, time, and a binary fraud label. The project involved loading the data, cleaning and preprocessing it, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), addressing class imbalance, training a Logistic Regression model, and evaluating its performance using metrics such as precision, recall, and ROC-AUC score.

**Skills:** data cleaning, data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), handling imbalanced data, logistic regression, classification metrics, ROC-AUC analysis, confusion matrix interpretation, data visualization.

**Technology:**  Python, Pandas, Sckitlearn, Seaborn, Matplotlib.

**Results:** After preprocessing the dataset and addressing the class imbalance, a Logistic Regression model was trained using a balanced class weight configuration. The model demonstrated strong performance in detecting fraudulent transactions, achieving a recall of 0.92 on the minority class (fraud). This means that 92% of actual fraud cases were correctly identified by the model.

However, the precision was relatively low at 0.06, indicating that many of the transactions flagged as fraud were actually legitimate (false positives). Despite this, in real-world fraud detection, high recall is often prioritized to ensure minimal undetected fraud.

The model also achieved a ROC-AUC score of 0.9721, reflecting a high capability in distinguishing between fraudulent and legitimate transactions.

The confusion matrix further supports this result:
![confusion_matrix](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/78372e13-c46c-4b53-b638-51a8c38d8613)


Only 8 fraud cases were missed (false negatives), while 1,390 normal transactions were incorrectly flagged as fraud (false positives). Overall, the model provided a strong baseline for fraud detection and can be further improved using more advanced models or resampling techniques.
